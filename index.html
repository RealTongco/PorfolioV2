								<h1>Experience</h1>
								<h2 class="major">FIRST SEMESTER</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Fear, Self-Effacing and tremble that's what we felt when we enter and face the 2 panelist, base on my experience this is my first actual defense because I used to defense in virtual and its really different, your confidence are mixing when about to begin</a>.</p>
								<p>All of the emotion we felt suddenly vanish because we already conquer it. It was awesome because we are the first group who present our work, a first project made with team. Cooperate and Average IQ was activate on this day because this is our FINAL OUTPUT and we shouldn't mess this up.</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">Second Semester</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/186 defense.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A mix emotion moment when I was nominate as a Leader after reaching perfect score in Period 2 Exam. I didn't expect that I will lead the group and worrying because I didn't mastered the java yet.</p>
								<p>Ma'am Taypin let us choose between 1 to 15 and I choose the number 15 and it was Billing System, A lot of ideas came up into my mind after I received the project for this period 3. I finished my first code for 2 days and keep asking my members and friends to debug my code, I keep remaking the code and ask my friend to help me in looping because I don't master the looping yet, so I remastered 5 Billing system project.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/flopw chart.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>While defending our project I introduce it and explain how it works especially in flow chart. Our project is very simple and even my members can read it easily, by the time the panelist gave us task to debug and add Tax & Service Fee we easily debug and passed it successfully.</p>

								<p>I was out of time making my own HCI Project but Luckily my classmates let me join their group and I asked them what should I do or What can I contribute to the group? My classmate Catid replied "just buy some snacks for our panelist". also I am the one who introduce the project and the members too since they're kinda mousy.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/22.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Been playing online games for 8 years and still asking myself how did they made this AWESOME video game with a good graphics? so I decided to search and I found a lot of code and my mind was stunned "HOW DID THEY DO THIS!? HOW CAN YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND?" so I decide to ask which course is this and found out it was similar to Information Technology. Enrolled myself in Phinma Cagayan de Oro College and currently studying about python.</p>
